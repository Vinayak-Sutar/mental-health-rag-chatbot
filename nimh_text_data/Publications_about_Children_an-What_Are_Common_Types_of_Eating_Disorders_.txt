Eating disorders are serious illnesses marked by severe disturbances to one’s eating behaviors.  Here are common types of eating disorders.

Anorexia nervosa

People with anorexia nervosa severely avoid or restrict food intake due to a distorted self-image or an intense fear of gaining weight.

Binge-eating disorder

People with binge-eating disorder regularly lose control of their eating and eat unusually large amounts of food.

Bulimia nervosa

People with bulimia nervosa regularly binge eat and then engage in unhealthy behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting or the use of laxatives.

Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)

People with ARFID limit the amount and variety of food they eat due to their anxiety or fear of the consequences of eating or dislike of a food’s characteristics.

People with these types of symptoms may have an eating disorder and should talk to a health care provider. Help is available.
