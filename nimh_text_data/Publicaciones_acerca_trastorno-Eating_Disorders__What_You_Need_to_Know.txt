What are eating disorders?

Eating disorders are serious illnesses marked by severe disturbances to one’s eating behaviors. Although many people may be concerned about their health, weight, or appearance from time to time, some people become fixated or obsessed with weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling their food intake. These may be signs of an eating disorder.

Eating disorders are not a choice. These disorders can adversely affect a person’s physical and mental health, and in some cases, they can be life-threatening. With treatment, however, people can recover from eating disorders.

Who is at risk for eating disorders?

Eating disorders can affect people of all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds, body weights, and sexes. Even people who appear healthy can have eating disorders and be extremely ill. People with eating disorders can be underweight, average weight, or overweight.

The exact cause of eating disorders is not fully understood. Research suggests a combination of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors can raise a person’s risk.

What are the common types of eating disorders?

Common types of eating disorders include:

Anorexia nervosa: People with anorexia nervosa severely avoid or restrict food intake due to a distorted self-image or an intense fear of gaining weight. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as overweight. Some people with anorexia nervosa may also have binge eating and purging episodes.

Binge-eating disorder: People with binge-eating disorder regularly lose control of their eating and eat unusually large amounts of food. People with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese.

Bulimia nervosa: People with bulimia nervosa regularly binge eat and then engage in unhealthy behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting or the use of laxatives. People with bulimia nervosa may maintain an average weight or be overweight.

Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): People with ARFID limit the amount and variety of food they eat due to their anxiety or fear of the consequences of eating (such as choking or vomiting) or dislike of a food’s characteristics (such as its appearance or texture). People with ARFID are frequently underweight.

People exhibiting any combination of these symptoms may have an eating disorder and should talk to a health care provider.

What mental illnesses can co-occur with eating disorders?

People with eating disorders are at risk for co-occurring mental illnesses, which most often include depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. People with eating disorders are also at a higher risk for suicide. It’s critical to treat any co-occurring conditions as part of the treatment plan.

How are eating disorders treated?

Eating disorders can be treated successfully. Early detection and treatment are important for recovery. Treatment plans for eating disorders include:

Individual, group, or family psychotherapyto identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors about food. Learn more aboutpsychotherapy.

Medical care and monitoringto treat the health consequences of an eating disorder and monitor overall well-being.

Nutritional counselingto help people eat well and reach and maintain a healthy weight.

Medicationto treat the symptoms of some eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, and to reduce symptoms of co-occurring anxiety or depression. There are currently no medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the symptoms of anorexia nervosa or ARFID.

Some people with a severe eating disorder may need to be in a hospital or residential treatment program.

A person’s family can play a crucial role in treatment. They can encourage a family member with eating or body image issues to seek help and can provide support during treatment. Research suggests that family-based treatment can improve eating disorder treatment outcomes, particularly for adolescents.

What are clinical trials and why are they important?

Clinical trials are research studies that look at ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. These studies help show whether a treatment is safe and effective in people. Some people join clinical trials to help doctors and researchers learn more about a disease and improve health care. Other people, such as those with health conditions, join to try treatments that aren’t widely available.

NIMH supports clinical trials across the United States. Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials and whether one is right for you. Learn more aboutparticipating in clinical trials.
